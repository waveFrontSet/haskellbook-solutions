# My solutions to the exercises in the Haskellbook

These are just my solutions to the programming exercises from the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](https://haskellbook.com/).

## Setup

If you want to examine the solutions, you need to install the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/). On macs, a simple `brew install ghc` should suffice.
