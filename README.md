# My solutions to the exercises in the Haskellbook

These are just my solutions to the programming exercises from the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](https://haskellbook.com/).

## Setup

If you want to examine the solutions, you need to install `stack`. On macs, a simple `brew install stack` should suffice. Afterwards, you can build the project and install dependencies by executing `stack build`.

### Trying out solutions

To fire up `ghci`, execute `stack ghci` inside the project folder. You can then load functions from the source files by using

```
:load path/to/haskell.hs
```
